Technologies in use:
--------------------


HTML:

We use HTML for the site structure. This is required to fill out the pages with other elements later in the process.
Some common elements that we have used are tables, navigation bars with links, sections, headers, footers, links and paragraphs.


CSS:

We have used CSS to style our web page to our liking. We have gone for a simple but stylish look and have used CSS to shape
the web page to that look. We control colors, size, text, positions and other key features with css. We decided to divide
the CSS into several files to make it more organized and easier to maintain.


XML:
We have used XML to store information about the movies that we currently have in our system. This combined with JavaScript
is used to display the movies. 


JavaScript:
We have used JavaScript to fetch and display the movies from an XML-file. We have used functions to get elements from the HTML-page
and edit/add elements to them. Additionally, we wrote methods for sorting all the movies (by views etc.) and for searching for a 
specific title. We have implemented separate .js files, but we have also written JavaScript into the head of some 
HTML files.
